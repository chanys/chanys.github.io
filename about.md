Hi! I am Yee Seng Chan and this is my blog where I write about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies such as large language models (e.g. ChatGPT, LaMDA).

I did a PhD in NLP, followed by a Post-doc at UIUC. I then worked at Raytheon BBN Technologies for many years. BBN is a R&D company that was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2013. I then left BBN to join a startup, which focused on Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
 
While at BBN, I was the Principal Investigator and Engineering Lead in multiple multi-million NLP programs. I was also the creator, architect, and primary developer of BBN's deep learning R&D system that was used in almost all of BBN's NLP programs. The system that I developed builds upon Transformer based models to perform various information extraction tasks such as event extraction, relation extraction, named entity recognition, etc. For 2 years running, I was also selected and served as an expert advisor and judge for Raytheon Innovation Challenge, on topics regarding "AI, ML, and Expert systems for National Security". In my role at the SEO startup, I managed the NLP, ML, and Data Science team, where we applied state-of-the-art NLP techniques to create solutions for search intent, content generation, etc.
